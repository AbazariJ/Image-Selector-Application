Objects have a soft, hand-molded appearance with visible fingerprints and subtle imperfections. It has a charming, friendly, and slightly quirky feel.\n\n        Your task is to generate a JSON object with two keys: \"profilePrompt\" and \"bannerPrompt\".\n\n        1.  **profilePrompt**: Create a prompt for a minimalist, iconic, centered logo (1:1 ratio). It should be a clean, vector-style emblem suitable for a small profile picture. Focus on the 'coreSubject'. The style should be a perfect fusion of the analysis and the chosen visual style.\n        2.  **bannerPrompt**: Create a prompt for a wide-angle, cinematic, and detailed banner image (16:9 ratio). This prompt should create an expansive scene that builds on the 'theme' and incorporates the 'secondaryElements'. It should be atmospheric and visually rich, fully embracing the chosen style.\n\n        Append the following negative prompts to the end of BOTH prompts: \"--no text, words, signature, blurry, watermark, human figures, letters\".\n    "
